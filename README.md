### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maria Korneeva.

I am a Frontend Technology Lead at Aleri with current focus on Angular. I write for [ng-conf](http://ng-conf.org) and speak now and there at tech meetups and conferences. I share my learnings from everyday coding in tweets and articles. Fun fact: I illustrate my stories myself because I like drawing.
More on [Medium](https://browserperson.medium.com/),[Twitter](https://twitter.com/BrowserPerson) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-korneeva/).
